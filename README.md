# Most Sold Multiplatform Videogames App Description
Used JavaScript to code an app that allows users to look through the Most Sold Multiplatform Video Games in 2020. The user would click the randomize button to have a random multiplatform videogame be displayed. The information that would be displayed regarding the video game that was randomly selected would be the video game title, the image of the video game, the publisher, and the copies sold. Additionally, if the user wanted more information they would click the info icon which would give a brief description of the video game along with a different image from the video game.
